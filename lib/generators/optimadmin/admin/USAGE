Description:
    A generator to generate admin views

Example:
    rails generate optimadmin:admin Thing

    This will create:
        controllers/optimadmin/things_controller.rb
        views/optimadmin/things/index.html.erb
        views/optimadmin/things/new.html.erb
        views/optimadmin/things/edit.html.erb
        views/optimadmin/things/_form.html.erb

    rails generate admin Thing title image:image document:document display:boolean

    This will create all the things above but setup image_field for the image, document_field for the document and all booleans will go into
    the settings section of the form
